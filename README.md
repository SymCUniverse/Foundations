# SymC Foundations

The **SymC Foundations** repository contains the core theoretical works underlying the Symmetry of Criticality (SymC) framework. SymC describes a universal stability structure centered on the critically damped boundary χ = 1, governing adaptive behavior across quantum, biological, cosmological, and informational systems.

This repository includes only the foundational theory papers. Domain-specific applications (medicine, markets, seismology, oncology, cognition) are maintained separately.
