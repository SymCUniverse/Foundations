\section*{Overview}

This repository contains the foundational research papers and theoretical developments underlying the SymC framework. SymC (Symmetry of Criticality) proposes that the critically damped boundary, expressed through the dimensionless ratio
\[
\chi = \frac{\gamma}{2|\omega|},
\]
functions as a universal stability coordinate for open systems across physical, biological, and informational domains.

The works included here define the mathematical and conceptual basis of the framework, including exceptional-point structure, dissipative quantum dynamics, substrate inheritance, adaptive windows, and cross-scale unification. Application-specific research (neurology, oncology, seismology, economics, etc.) is intentionally excluded from this repository.

\section*{Contents}

\subsection*{Core Theoretical Papers}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SymC Postulate (v3)}: Establishes $\chi$ as a universal boundary condition linking stability, information efficiency, and adaptive behavior near criticality.
    \item \textbf{SymC Noughts}: Introduces substrate noughts as invariant carriers of inherited structure across hierarchical systems.
    \item \textbf{Closing Gaps with SymC (v2)}: Formalizes substrate inheritance and demonstrates how stabilized lower-level architectures constrain higher-order dynamics.
    \item \textbf{SymC AIF}: Connects SymC structure to predictive processing, active inference, and free-energy minimization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Quantum and Mathematical Foundations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SymC Lindblad (v4)}: Develops the geometry of dissipative Lindblad operators, exceptional points, and critical damping in open quantum systems.
    \item \textbf{SymC and the QFT (v2)}: Derives $\chi$-structure in quantum field relaxation, boundary layers, and universal propagator behavior at second-order exceptional points.
    \item \textbf{SymC Neutrinos}: Reinterprets neutrino flavor oscillations as a stability transition governed by the damping ratio.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conceptual Summary}

The SymC framework identifies $\chi = 1$ as a second-order exceptional point marking:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the coalescence of propagator poles,
    \item maximal information efficiency,
    \item fastest monotone relaxation,
    \item the transition between underdamped and overdamped regimes.
\end{itemize}

Systems operating within the adaptive window $0.8 \lesssim \chi \lesssim 1.0$ exhibit stability and responsiveness. Departures toward $\chi < 0.8$ (underdamped) or $\chi > 1.2$ (overdamped) correlate with instability or rigidity.

This structure emerges across quantum dissipation, cosmological perturbations, biological regulation, predictive processing, substrate inheritance, and cross-domain dynamical systems. The recurrence follows from a general principle: any system linearizable near a stationary point inherits $\chi$-structure by necessity.

\section*{Purpose of This Repository}

This repository serves as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a consolidated archive of the mathematical foundations of SymC,
    \item a stable reference for all DOI-linked foundational papers,
    \item a source of supplementary materials for core derivations,
    \item a framework base upon which domain-specific research can be built.
\end{itemize}

Application papers are stored separately and are not included here.

\section*{Usage Notes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each PDF corresponds to a specific Zenodo release and associated DOI.
    \item Supplementary materials are provided where extended derivations are required.
    \item Documents are version-labeled rather than overwritten to preserve historical integrity.
\end{itemize}
