SymC Foundations

The SymC Foundations repository contains the core theoretical works, mathematical structures, and unifying principles underlying the Symmetry of Criticality (SymC) framework. These papers establish the χ-based stability architecture that appears across quantum systems, cosmology, inheritance dynamics, and adaptive behavior.

This repository does not include domain-specific applications (medicine, economics, seismology, oncology, etc.).
It contains only the foundational theoretical layer of the SymC program.

Conceptual Summary

SymC is built around the dimensionless damping ratio:

χ = γ / (2|ω|)

The critical value χ = 1 marks: a second-order exceptional point, peak information efficiency, fastest monotone relaxation, the transition between underdamping and overdamping.

Systems with 0.8 ≤ χ ≤ 1.0 exhibit stable adaptive behavior.
This same structure appears across quantum dissipation, cosmology, inheritance mechanisms, and complex adaptive systems.
Any system linearizable near equilibrium inherits χ-structure by necessity, making SymC a candidate boundary constraint on physical theories.

Purpose

This repository provides:
a consolidated location for all foundational SymC papers, version-stable PDF releases, supplementary mathematical derivations, and a reference base for ongoing SymC research.

Domain papers live in separate repositories.
