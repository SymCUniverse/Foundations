# SymC Foundations

The **SymC Foundations** repository contains the core theoretical works underlying the Symmetry of Criticality (SymC) framework. SymC describes a universal stability structure centered on the critically damped boundary χ = 1, governing adaptive behavior across quantum, biological, cosmological, and informational systems.

This repository includes only the foundational theory papers. Domain-specific applications (medicine, markets, seismology, oncology, cognition) are maintained separately.

## Conceptual Summary

This repository is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).
See the LICENSE file for details.
SymC is based on the dimensionless damping ratio:

χ = γ / (2|ω|)

At the critical value **χ = 1**, systems reach:

- maximal information efficiency  
- coalescence of propagator poles  
- fastest monotone relaxation  
- the transition between underdamped and overdamped regimes  

Stable adaptive behavior occurs within **0.8 ≤ χ ≤ 1.0**, while deviations lead to instability or rigidity.

This structure appears across quantum dissipation, cosmology, inheritance systems, and adaptive control, arising from general linear stability principles.
